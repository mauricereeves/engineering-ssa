## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) for the purposes of demoing Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and USWDS for use in engineering projects at the SSA.

As this project grows it can be used to track and add information about different projects and APIs at the SSA that engineers can add information to and search so they can hook into existing projects and not build similar functionality to what already exists.

This project is part of the OCIO Product Operating Model Office of Engineering Team.

npm run dev
# or
